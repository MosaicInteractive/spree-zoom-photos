= Zoom Photos

Want zoomable product photos for your Spree store's customers?  This extension might be what you're looking for.

Uses the jqzoom evolution jquery plugin (version 1.0.1) courtesy of Renzi Marco: http://www.mind-projects.it/projects/jqzoom/ - many thanks.

Demos of jqzoom (these demos are not in a Spree app):

http://www.mind-projects.it/projects/jqzoom/demos.php

The extension has a blank jqzoom.custom.css file that you may want to override in your own extension
rather than copying and modifying the jqzoom.css file.

Contributions, bug reports, etc. welcome.

Best regards,

Eliot Sykes
